The purchase is guaranteed. No gas war.

<h3> What's the accepted currency for a IDO? ETH, BNB, USDT or BUSD? </h3>

That is the project team's decision. Please check in the pool, in **“Supported”** field.

<h3> How can I buy .... token (on BSC) if I am staking on ETH? I join with same address I use to stake on ETH? </h3>

Yes, the same address to stake/buy. You must switch from ETH to BSC network on BOTH your wallet and Red Kite to buy tokens.

<h3> Hi, why my allocation reduce from 2 ETH to 1.7 ETH? </h3>

It is due to ETH/BNB price fluctuation. The fixed rate will be set according to the market price right before IDO time.
