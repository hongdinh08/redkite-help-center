That is the project team's decision.

<h3> How can I buy .... token (on BSC) if I am staking on ETH? I join with same address I use to stake on ETH? </h3>

Yes, the same address to stake/buy. You must switch from ETH to BSC network on BOTH your wallet and Red Kite to buy tokens.

<h3> Hi, why my allocation reduce? from 2 ETH to 1.7 ETH </h3>

It is due to ETH/BNB price fluctuation. The fixed rate will be set according to the market price right before IDO time.
