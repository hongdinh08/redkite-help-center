<h3> What are the upcoming ido's? </h3>

We will update the upcoming IDOs on [**Red Kite**](https://redkite.polkafoundry.com/#/dashboard). You can check there.

<h3> There is no BSC DEX or CEX for PKF. How can I use BSC for Red Kite? Is there any explanation for that? </h3>

* PKF is only available on Ethereum and you have to stake PKF on Ethereum network.

* Red Kite supports launching both ETH & BSC tokens. It is the token of the project under launch, not related to $PKF.

<h3> What are the prohibited countries from joining launches on Red Kite? </h3>

Red Kite prohibited countries list includes United States of America, China, Hong Kong, and all sanctioned OFAC countries (DR Congo, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan, Iraq, Ivory Coast, North Korea, Syria, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Belarus, Liberia). 

However, each pool regulation will be different due to the project team's decision. Please check each pool information to know residents/ citizens from which countries can't participate.
