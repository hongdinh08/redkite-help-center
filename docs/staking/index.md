# STAKING

---

<h3> We can stake $PKF in Binance Smart Chain or ETH for getting into tiers? </h3>

Staking $PKF is only on ETH network. Buying IDO tokens can be on ETH or BSC network (depending on the project decision).

<h3> Does holding on Gate.io or MantraDAO count towards IDOs staking? </h3>

No, you must stake on Red Kite.

<h3> I have already staked through metamask and my transaction is successful but I still see that it is not coming under staked column. What should i do now ? I staked my PKF, tx approved, not showing as staked. What do I do? </h3>

Please make sure that you did two steps. 

* Step 1. Approve Red Kite smart contract
* Step 2. Stake
