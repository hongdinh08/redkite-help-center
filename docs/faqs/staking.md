# STAKING

<h3> Can I stake $PKF in BSC or ETH to get into tiers? </h3>

Staking $PKF is only on ETH network. Buying IDO tokens can be on ETH or BSC network (depending on the project decision).

<h3> Does holding $PKF on gate.io or MantraDAO count towards IDOs staking? </h3>

No, you must stake on Red Kite.

Please make sure that you did two steps. 

* Step 1. Approve Red Kite smart contract
* Step 2. Stake
