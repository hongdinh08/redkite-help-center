# WHITELIST

---

### I applied whitelist for the last IDO, do I have to do it again? 

Yes, you are required to apply whitelist every time you join a pool.

### How can I qualify for Whitelist? 

1. Participants need to have KYC verified and qualify the min tier of the pool. 

2. **Dove** and **Hawk** somtimes have to fullfil social requirements (Twiter + Telegram). This depends on the IDO projects.

### How can I apply Whitelist? 

For public sale, you need to click **[Apply Whitelist]**  and fill out Whitelist Registration form.

### I submited the whitelist for a IDO on Red Kite, but I was lower tier (Dove). Now I have upgraded my tier, do I have to resubmit the whitelist application form? 

No, you don't need to.
